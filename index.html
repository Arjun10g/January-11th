        <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">A comparison of independent Samples</h2>
        <p>Let's say, we have 2 samples, one for heights of students at York University in 2010, and another for heights of students in 2023. <b>How would you compare them?</b> One simple way, would be to simply estimate a measure of central tendency for each sample and compare the two. </p>
        <div class="frame"><iframe src="tab.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
        <p>Looking at the means, there seems to be a clear difference in heights between the two groups. But how can we say with a certain degree of certainty that these two groups truly differ in height? what other information should we be examining?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A measure of uncertainty?</li>
          <li>A measure of variability?</li>
          <li>The distributions?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="frame" style = 'height: 20vh;margin-bottom: 40px;'><iframe src="tab2.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

        <p>Simply speaking, the independent samples t-test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups.</p>
        <p>n practical terms, the independent samples t-test is particularly useful in scenarios where researchers want to investigate if there is a statistically significant distinction in the means of two groups, such as comparing the average test scores of students who received different teaching methods, or examining the average performance of two groups exposed to different experimental conditions.</p>

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Normality:</strong> Each group should follow a normal distribution. Note that the t-test is robust to deviations from normality with larger sample sizes (typically, n > 30).</li>
          
          <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity):</strong> The variances of the two groups being compared should be roughly equal. Violations can affect pcision, particularly if sample sizes are unequal.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Observations within each group must be independent, and the two groups must be independent of each other.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Scale of Measurement:</strong> The data should be measured on an interval or ratio scale. The t-test assumes meaningful differences between observations and an appropriate scale of measurement.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How realistic are these Assumptions?</h2>
        <p>It's important to note that the t-test is robust, meaning that it can still provide valid results even if some assumptions are mildly violated, especially when sample sizes are large. However, researchers should be cautious when assumptions are significantly violated or when dealing with small sample sizes. In such cases, alternative tests should be considered.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        </div>
        <h2>So, what now?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Formulate Hypotheses:</strong> Define your null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1). Typically, H0 assumes no difference between groups, while H1 posits a significant difference.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Collect Data:</strong> Gather data from two independent groups. Ensure that the data meets the assumptions of the t-test.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Assess Assumptions:</strong> Check for normality within each group, homogeneity of variances, independence, and appropriate scale of measurement.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Calculate Test Statistic (t):</strong> Using the formula for the independent sample t-test:
            
            \[ t = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} \]
            
            where:
            - \(\bar{X}_1, \bar{X}_2\) are the sample means of Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.
            - \(s_1, s_2\) are the sample standard deviations of Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.
            - \(n_1, n_2\) are the sample sizes of Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Find Critical Value or P-Value:</strong> Based on the calculated t-statistic and degrees of freedom, find the critical value from the t-distribution table or use statistical software. Alternatively, calculate the p-value.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Make a Decision:</strong> Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value. If the absolute value of the t-statistic is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level, reject the null hypothesis.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Calculate Pooled Standard Error (pooled SE):</strong> In the case of unequal variances, calculate the pooled standard error using the formula:
            
            \[ SE_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} \left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)} \]
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Draw a Conclusion:</strong> Based on the comparison of the t-statistic and critical value or the p-value, draw a conclusion about the statistical significance of the observed difference between the two groups.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Sample Problem:</h2>
        <p>Suppose we are conducting a study to compare the exam scores of two different teaching methods, Method A and Method B. We collect exam scores from two independent groups of students: Group A (taught using Method A) and Group B (taught using Method B).</p>
        <p>
        Group A (Method A):
        \[ X_{A} = [78, 85, 92, 88, 95] \]
        \[ n_{A} = 5 \]

        Group B (Method B):
        \[ X_{B} = [68, 72, 78, 65, 70] \]
        \[ n_{B} = 5 \]
        </p>

        <h2>Solution:</h2>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 1: Formulate Hypotheses</strong></p>
        <p>
        \[ H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B \]
        \[ H_1: \mu_A \neq \mu_B \]
        </p>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 2: Choose  Level</strong></p>
        <p>Let's set \(\alpha = 0.05\).</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 3: Conduct T-Test</strong></p>
        <p>
        \[ t = \frac{(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}} \]
        </p>
        <p>where \(\bar{X}_A\), \(\bar{X}_B\) are sample means, \(s_A\), \(s_B\) are sample standard deviations, and \(n_A\), \(n_B\) are sample sizes.</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 4: Calculate DOF</strong></p>
        <p>
        \[ df = n_A + n_B - 2 \]
        </p>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 5: Find Critical Value</strong></p>
        <p>Using a t-table, find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with \(\alpha = 0.05\) and degrees of freedom \(df\).</p>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 6: Compare t-statistic to critical value</strong></p>
        <p>
        \[ |t| &gt; t_{\text{critical}} \, ? \, \text{Reject } H_0 : \mu_A = \mu_B \, \text{ if true} \]
        </p>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 7: Find p-value</strong></p>
        <p>Using t-tables, find the p-value associated with the calculated t-statistic. If \(p &lt; \alpha\), reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <p style = "text-align: center;"><strong>Step 8: Make Decision</strong></p>
        <p>
        \[ p &lt; \alpha \, ? \, \text{Reject } H_0 : \mu_A = \mu_B \, \text{ if true} \]
        </p>
